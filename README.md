# Welcome to blockchain-demo

The blockchain-demo is a single page web application using VueJS, Vuex, and Bootstrap. This app models a basic blockchain such as what can be found on [blockchaindemo.io/](https://blockchaindemo.io/).

This project models the functionality of a very simple blockchain that does not include transactions. This means a list of blocks, where a block is a set of attributes (timestamp/block-creation time, data, previous/parent hash, nonce) and a hash of this set of attributes.

# Installation instructions
